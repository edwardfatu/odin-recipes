Git repository created for the use of an odin project

This project will demonstrate what I have learned in the HTML course 
section of the Odin Project. Items that will be inlcuded 
(but not limited to) in this project are listed below. (Note: these are all 
elements and attributes that have been outlined in the course material)

-Writing the initital start of an HTML document (ie. HTML boilerplate)
-Using headings, paragraphs and text attributes to change the 
    formatting (ie. to show emphasis)
-Creating absolute and relative links to other pages either located 
    on the website itself or on another website
-Placing images either locally or from other websites
